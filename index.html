 <p>Philippines also known as the Pearl of the Orient Seas, an archipelago home of 7,641 islands.</p>
  <p>Located in Southeastern Asia, between South China sea and near the Pacific Ocean.</p>
  <p>The islands extend about 1,850 kilometers from north to south and almost 1,127 kilometers from east to west.</p>
  <p>The coastlines of all the islands are extremely irregular, measuring about 36,289 kilometers in length.</p>
  <p>The land has a total area of 300,000 km² (115,831 mi²). It is divided in 3 regions.</p>
</center>
  <h4>History</h4>
  <h4>PRECOLONIAL PERIOD</h4>

<p>The state of the Precolonial period of Philippines showed the diverse culture of different tribes that reigned during that period.
Before the colonizers came, our culture and tradition are highly influenced by neighboring countries such as Indo-Malayan countries and China. Back then, trade or 
"barter" was practiced by these countries which lead to exchanging of native products amongst the people involved, mainly merchants. This formed a healthy relationship
among these countries. Studies showed that Filipinos
used native root crops and gold to trade items such as mirror, porcelain, silk.</p>

<br>
<p>There is also a classified system to determine the status of a person. It was divided into 4 classes
<p>Maginoo (Noble Class): royal blooded such as Datu (the ruler of a certain place or tribe)
They are addressed as Ginoo and for the women equivalent is Dayang.</p>
<p>Timawa (commoners): in today's society this is classified as the middle to high class within the community. They enjoy the privilege of having a job, aquiring a 
property and have a slave. In exchange, they are expected to pay taxes.</p>
<p>Maharlika (noble warriors): they are the respected warriors in the community. They ought to serve the "Datu" and the community to protect it from being held captive
or to fight for their community whenever war between clans or tribes arises. </p>
<p>Alipin (slaves): there are 2 kinds of slaves (alipuing namamahay and aliping saguiguilid)
Aliping Namamahay: are slaves that have their own quarters inside the property of their master. They also have the freedom to choose their husband or wife.
They are paid if they fulfilled their duties such as cooking, cleaning, and aiding their master.
Aliping Saguiguilid: they are lowest of the class. They don't have any property of their own, to choose their own husband or wife, and they aren't paid.</p>

Philippines also had its own form of writing system known as Baybayin or Alibata.
 It resembles other Indic scripts such as Devanagari used for Hindi, Tamil, and Javanese. </p>

<h4>SPANISH OCCUPATION</h4>
<p>Ferdinand Magellan was ordered to navigate and set sail across the globe. Upon his circumnavigation he came across an island or archipelago which is the Philippines. 
He set foot and landed on the shores of Mactan Cebu, he claimed the land on behalf of the King's name. However, he failed to do so because of the Chief "Datu Lapu-lapu"
who fought for his land and its people. Following several more expeditions, the spanish breads permanently settled on the island specifically on Cebu circa 1565. After killing
a local muslim chief, the Spanish set up their capital at Manila in 1571, and they named their new colony after King Philip II of Spain. They negotiated with Asian countries
such as Japan and China to trade spices. One of their goals to mask their colonization of the Philippines, they used the spread of Christianity as an excuse to atleast
mitigate the fear of the citizens and to gain their trust. Later on, the Spanish government assigned or tasked religious priests and officers to Christianized the population.
They immediately gained control of the whole country through their power.</p>
<p>But the locals were tired of being opressed by these colonizer. They fought for their freedom to help regain the might of the locals and reclaim what are theirs. 
The execution of the infamous 3 priests also known as 'GOMBURZA' became a big eye opener for everyone who witnessed the unjust system that the Spaniards implied. 
These priests were falsely accused for orchestrating the Cavite Mutiny of 1872, and charged with treason and sedition by Spanish authorities. 
They were sentenced to public execution by garrote in the same year.
These sparked the nationalism of ordinary people who were enlightened by this wrongful act that
the Spaniards commited. Soon after, people began to revolt against the Spanish government. 
For an instance, La Liga Filipina (a group of educated Filipinos who spread their disagreement of the Spanish government by educating mere people by writing 
manuscripts, books, articles, and newspapers. Another example was, The Katipunan (founded by Andres Bonifacio, contradicting the beliefs of Rizal The Katipunan
fought for freedom by using swords instead of pen and paper).

Rizal's execution sparked a wider uprising against the Spanish authority. The Philippine Revolution, which started in 1896 under the leadership of heroes like Bonifacio, involved numerous conflicts with Spanish forces on various fronts. By 1898, Spain was engaged in the Spanish-American War and battling to put an end to the uprisings in the Philippines. As stipulated in the Treaty of Paris of 1898, Spain gave up the Philippines and other territories to the US in exchange for US $20 million after losing to the US in a number of land and naval conflicts. The American Anti-Imperialist League opposed the annexation of the Philippines during the treaty's negotiations. composed of eminent figures from the social,
 political, and economic spheres of the day such as campaigner Jane Addams.

<br>
<br>
<h4>AMERICAN OCCUPATION</h4>
<p>The Senate vigorously debated the deal. On February 6, 1899, the treaty was finally ratified by a vote of fifty-seven in favor and twenty-seven against, which was one vote more than the necessary two-thirds majority. 
In the meantime, Emilio Aguinaldo, a prominent Filipino in the struggle for independence, proclaimed an independent Philippine government, which neither the Spanish nor the American governments recognized.
 The islands were once again made subject to the laws and regulations of a far-off country when the Treaty of Paris' final form came into effect.</p>
On February 4, 1899, American forces opened fire on Filipinos in Manila, sparking the start of the Philippine-American War. Filipino guerilla armies fed up with living under foreign control engaged the new US conquerors in battle during the early years of US colonization. Over 4,000 American and 16,000 Filipino soldiers, as well as nearly one million civilians who died from hunger and disease, are among the war's estimated casualties, according to James Hamilton-Paterson, a British travel writer and commentator on the Philippines.10 Although the war was declared over in 1902, skirmishes continued for a number of years after that.
The Philippines were formed as a commonwealth by the United States in 1935, along with a Philippine government that was intended to serve as a bridge to full independence.

<br>
<h4>WORLD WAR II AND JAPANESE OCCUPATION</h4>
<p> However, Japan invaded the Philippines during World War II and occupied it from 1941 to 1945. In "World War II and the Japanese in the Prewar Philippines" (1996), Lydia N. Yu-Jose writes that there were about 20,000 Japanese immigrants living on the islands before the war.15 Some of them were transients who were content to work in the Philippines for a number of years before returning to Japan with their earnings. 
Others were long-term residents, and many of them went on to start businesses including farms, factories, and logging operations. Yu-Jose adds that some
of the occupying army used them as advisors and put them as local authorities. Some people initially saw the Japanese as liberators who had freed the Philippines from American rule and incorporated the islands into the Japanese empire. But unpleasant truths emerged in the wake of the succeeding war's crimes. The Japanese proclaimed José P. Laurel as president of what is now known as the Second Philippine Republic in October 1943. The prevailing Japanese military persisted in occupying the region despite being widely acknowledged as only a puppet regime. 
Filipinos experienced food shortages while local firms under Japanese control produced commodities for the war effort.
In light of this, Filipinos organized massive resistance across the islands once more. 
Guerrilla warfare was employed by over 250,000 individuals against the Japanese occupiers, who gradually lost power as the war went on. 
Famous General Douglas MacArthur organized US forces to fight with the Filipinos during the conflict. 
The Battle of Manila, which took place from February to March 1945, featured American and Filipino troops and ultimately signaled the end of the occupation.
 At least 100,000 citizens perished throughout this month at the hands of Japanese troops. Researchers calculate that between 500,000 and 1 million Filipinos perished overall during the Japanese occupation of the country during World War Two.

On July 4, 1946, the Treaty of Manila was ratified by the United States and the Philippines, marking the end of the war. 
Manuel Roxas then became the first president of the newly independent Filipino Republic after stepping down as leader of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.</p>

<h4>CULTURES AND BELIEFS</h4>
<p>Most Filipinos practise Christianity as their religion, Islam and other indigenous faiths are also seen in movement. Their religious spirit can be witnessed during festivals such as Ati-Atihan, Kaamulan, Panabenga, and the famous 3-month-celebration for Christmas.
The culture of the Philippines comprises a blend of traditional Filipino and Spanish Catholic traditions, with influences from America and other parts of Asia. The Filipinos are family oriented and often religious with an appreciation for art, fashion, music and food.
Filipinos are also hospitable people who love to have a good time. This often includes getting together to sing, dance, and eat. The annual calendar is packed with festivals, many of which combine costumes and rituals from the nation’s pre-Christian past with the Catholic beliefs and ideology of present day.</p>
